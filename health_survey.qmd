## Questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q10

Address the values of each of the variables (use the codebook for this and include your answer as comments). For instance, is "none" equal to a value other than 0? Are there extra decimals implied? Are there other values that should be excluded based on the responses they represent? Which variable will you seek to predict from the other variables? Answer these questions in the *Q10 Discussion:* section below the code chunk. Update the dataset to account for these values for the remainder of the questions in this part.

### TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW ###

# EDUCA: What is the highest grade or year of school you completed?
# 1Never attended school or only kindergarten
# 2 Grades 1 through 8, #3 Grades 9 through 11, # 4 Grade 12 or GED 
# 5 College 1 year to 3 years,#6 College 4 years or more, #9 Refused
#BLANK Not asked or Missing

#EMPLOY1: Description Are you currently…?
#1 Employed for wages, # 2 Self-employed, #3 Out of work for 1 year or more 
#4 Out of work for less than 1 year, #5 A homemaker, #6 A student 
#7 Retired,  #8 Unable to work, # 9 Refused

#WEIGHT2: 50 - 0999 Weight (pounds), 7777 Don’t know/Not sure, 
#9000 - 9998 Weight (kilograms), 9999 Refused, BLANK Not asked or Missing

#HEIGHT3: 200 - 711 Height (ft/inches), 7777 Don’t know/Not sure,
#9000 - 9998 Height (meters/cm), 9999 Refused, BLANK Not asked or Missing

# filter HEIGHT >=200, This will return those who reported their height in feet
#and inches. educa remove the those who refused to answer(9) and missing 
#values (blank). For employ1 keep all those who answered (values  <= 6)
#mutate height3 to seperate feet from inches. Multiply feet by 12 to make it
#inches and then add together and put in under the var name HEIGHT3

### Q10 Discussion:
Your Q10 discussion goes here. Feel free to add more lines as needed.


EDUCA: The values BLANK - Not asked or Missing & 9 - Refused are not helpful,
 so those values were filtered out
EMPLOY1:  values 9 - Refused,is not helpful, so it was filtered out.
WEIGHT2:Will be using weight in pounds, so this mean we will only be keeping
values < 999, all other values will be filtered out.
HEIGHT3: Will only be using height in inches. This is done by targeting the 
feet/inches group with values between and including 200 and 711. The feet are 
separated from the inches and then converted to inches by multiplying the value
by 12, this is added to inches and assigned to HEIGHT3.

For this project I will use height, weight, and employment type to predict
education level.
 


### Q11

Remove any outliers for each applicable variable. Make sure you are updating the dataset from Q10 and using this dataset for the remainder of the questions. Briefly explain why you chose the method you used in the *Q11 Discussion* section. Within your code chunk, provide comments explaining what your code is doing.

### Q11 Discussion:
Your Q11 discussion goes here. Feel free to add more lines as needed.
Briefly explain why you chose the method you used in the *Q11 Discussion* section

I chose to use the method for two reasons:
  1. This is how it was taught in Module 4.
  2. Compared to other ways I found using outside resources, I found this to
    be visually easier for me to write out and read. 
    
    
    
### Q12

Complete exploratory analyses (for each variable) doing appropriate visualizations with ggplot2. Include visualizations that incorporate a combination of your variables within one plot. Provide an organized discussion of your observations for each of the plots in the *Q12 Discussion* section below.

### Q12 Discussion:
Your Q12 discussion goes here. Feel free to add more lines as needed.

histogram of WEIGHT2: Shows a slight right (positive) skew, telling us most 
data is to the left of the peak.

bar of HEIGHT3: has a model that looks roughly normally distributed. There are
prominent tails, this indicates kurtosis, meaning outliers on the shorter and
taller tails.

Q-Q plot of WEIGHT2 has a U shaped pattern above the line. This tells us that 
there is deviation from the standard normal distribution,and that the data has 
a right skew.

Q-Q plot of WEIGHT2, grouped by education level: This models follows the same 
above the line U shaped pattern for each education level. This tells us that 
there is deviation from the standard normal distribution,and that the data has 
a right skew.

Q-Q plot of HEIGHT3: Has an S - shaped pattern. This tells us that there is 
deviation from the standard normal distribution, and that there is kurtosis, 
meaning there are outliers on both tails.

Q-Q plot of HEIGHT3, grouped by education level:Has an S - shaped pattern. This
tells us that there is deviation from the standard normal distribution, and that
there is kurtosis, meaning there are outliers on both tails. On both the bottom
left and top right the education level college 4 years + has the most noticeable 
and prominent deviation from the line.

bar graph showing count for each education level: This shows that the most 
common education level for the participants in this study is college 4 +, with 
149118 people. The next most common grade level is 12 or GED with 111646 people. 
College 1-3 years is a close third with 110266 people. least most common
education level is Kindergarten or less with 0 people.

bar graph showing count for each employment type: The most common employment 
type, by far, is employed for wage, with 163251 people reporting this as their
employment type. The second most common is retired with 122554 people reporting.
The least common is out of work < 1 year with 8265 people.

bar graph of education filled with employment type: This model is busy, but can
still show some good information. The model helps most is to visually show how 
employed by wage is a dominant employment type for most education levels.

box plot of education and weight: This box plot show a very similar size and 
shape in the box plots for each education level. The median line has a very 
similar location in the box plots for each education level, and each education
level has a similar pattern for outlies.

box plot of education and height: These box plots also have a slight upward 
change with increase in education. There is slight difference in the size of the
boxes and the location of the median line in each box. This shows that there is
a slight increase in height as education level increases. 

scatter plot height predicting weight:  This shows a weak positive linear 
relationship. as height increases, so will weight. 

density graft of weight grouped by education level: This modes shows that the
weight at each education level follows a similar right (positive) skew. The peak
of each education level show where the values are concentrated. Each education
level follows a similar pattern.

density graft of height grouped by education level: This modes shows that height
at each education level follows a bell curve.The most distinct aspect of the
model wide shape and thick tails, giving a mesokurtic pattern. This tells us 
there are a lot of outliers on both ends. Education levels grade 1-8 and 
grade 9-11 have a slight right skew, while  12 or GED, college 1-3 years, and
college 4 years + have a slight left skew.

HEIGHT3: height inches

   Min.  1st Qu.  Median   Mean   3rd Qu.  Max. 
  56.00   64.00   67.00   66.81   70.00   79.00 

Mode: 66

The lowest value is 56 and the highest is 79. This shows us the range of
values in the data set. The Median, 67, is the middle value of all the data.
The mean, the average of all the values is 66.81, and the
mode, most occurring value is 66. 

The mean, median and mode are all similar, telling us that the data is normally 
distributed.Additionally, 50% of the data falls between the first quantile, 64,
and the third quantile,70.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEIGHT2: weight(pounds)

Min.  1st Qu.  Median   Mean    3rd Qu.    Max.

Mode: 200 
            
The lowest value is 90, and the highest is 506, this shows us the range of all
values in the data set. The Median, 172, tells the middle value. The mean,178.3,
is the average of all the data. The mean, 178.3, and the median, 172, are very 
close together. The mode, 200, and is higher than the mean and median. This 
tells us there's a left skewed distribution of the data. Additionally, 50% of 
the data falls between the first quantile, 145,and the third quantile,200.

### Q14 Discussion:
Your Q14 discussion goes here. Feel free to add more lines as needed.

Question 14 uses variables EPMLOY1, HEIGHT3, and WEIGHT2 to predict a persons
EDUCA, education level. 

5 linear models were created to find the best model to predict EDUCA.

The first models used EMPLOY1 to predict EDUCA. This model has a p-value that is
statistically significant, and  has a multiple R-squared of 0.03336, and
an adjusted R-squared of 0.03335. This model has only one predictor variable,
so that is why the R2 and adjusted R2 are basically the same. The R2 tells us 
that 34% of the variance can be explained by the independent variable.
 
A higher R squared and Adj R2 are better, since higher R2 and Adjust R2 show 
predictive accuracy, explaining how the model observes the data.
 
The second used HEIGHT3 to predict EDUCA. This model has a p-value that is 
statistically significant, and  has a multiple R-squared of 0.01207, and
 an adjusted R-squared of 0.01207.This model has only one predictor variable,
so that is why the R2 and adjusted R2 are basically the same. The R2 tells us 
that 12% of the variance can be explained by the independent variable.

The third model used WEIGHT2 to predict EDUCA. This model has a p-value that is
statistically significant, and  has a multiple R-squared of 0.0004774, and
 an adjusted R-squared of 0.0004749. The R2 tells us that 4.8% of the variance 
 can be explained by the independent variable
 
The forth model used HEIGHT3 & WEIGHT2 to predict EDUCA. Both variables have 
a statistically significant p-value. The model  produces multiple R-squared 
of 0.01939 and an adjusted R-squared of 0.01938. The R2 tells us 
that 19.39% of the variance can be explained by the independent variable. This
model has 2 predictors and the adjusted R2 takes the extra variables into 
consideration to determine the models fit. In this model the adjusted R2 values 
is almost the same as the R2 value. This tells us the the second
predictor improves the model as expected. 

The fifth models used EMPLOY1, HEIGHT3 AND WEIGHT2 to predict EDUCA. All three
variables have a statistically significant p-value.The model has a multiple 
R-squared of 0.04734, and adjusted R-squared of 0.04734.The R2 tells us 
that 47.73% of the variance can be explained by the independent variable. This
model has 2 predictors and the adjusted R2 takes the extra variables into 
consideration to determine the models fit. In this model the adjusted R2 values 
is almost the same as the R2 value. This tells us the the second
predictor improves the model as expected. 

next I used ANOVA() to compare all models. Model 4 (HEIGHT3 and WEIGHT2 
to predict EDUCA) and model 5 (EMPLOY1, HEIGHT3 AND WEIGHT2 to predict EDUCA) 
have a statistically significant p-value. Showing there is a 
statistically significant difference between model 4 and 5 to and all the other
models' group means with the ANOVA test.

next used ANOVA() to compare the two models, model 4 and model 5, that have a
statistically significant p-value in the first anova test. The second anova 
showed a statistically significant p-value for model 5 (EDUCA ~ EMPLOY1 + 
HEIGHT3 + WEIGHT2). This tells us there is a difference between the models' 
group means with this ANOVA test.

The AIC tells us how well a model will predict with new data. When comparing the
IAC of all the models, this shows that the fifth model (EDUCA ~ EMPLOY1 + 
HEIGHT3 + WEIGHT2) has the lowest AIC, indicating that this is the best model.

The best model is model 5, using EMPLOY1, HEIGHT3 and WEIGHT2 to predict EDUCA.
This model was chosen because for a few reasons, fist it has the lowest AIC. The 
next reason is because all variables have p-value that are significant in the 
summary of the linear model.Another reason is when comparing all 5 models with
ANOVA() function,it shows us that model 5 and 4 were the only models with a 
statistically significant p-value. Additionally when using 
ANOVA () to compare model 4 and 5, shows a statistically 
significant difference between these two models. The fifth model
is the better model, so that's why I chose model 5 (EDUCA ~ EMPLOY1 + 
HEIGHT3 + WEIGHT2)
